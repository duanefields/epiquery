## Configuration 

Config, JSON object accessible via environment variable EPIQUERY_CONFIG as either the object itself (JSON) or
a file containing JSON.

### Connection Config
  In order to support backwards compatablility, there is the concept of a default connection.  If 
a request indicates no named connection, the default connection will be used.  Connections must be
explicitly marked as default in their configuration.  If multiple connections are marked as default
the first one found will be used (order is not guaranteed in configuration, so this is
non-deterministic behavior).  In the case of no connections being marked as default inbound requests
without a connection indicator will not be mapped to any connection and will thus fail.

### Sample Configuration
    {
      "connections":{
        "sql_conn": {"user":"", "password":"", "host":"", "port":"", "driver":"mssql" },
        "sql_conn_2": {"user":"", "password":"", "host":"", "port":"", "driver":"mssql" }
        "mysql_conn": {"user":"", "password":"", "host":"", "port":"", "driver":"mysql"}
      }
      "templateDir":"",
      "httpPort":8080
    }
 
Request URL Format
http://<server>/<template path>/<connection_name>`
